			<h2> The holiday for getting and giving gifts you actually need!</h2>
				<p> We're all tired of holidays where we have to wrack our brain to make sure all our gifts are thoughtful or funny.  We've all wished we could ask for what we really need (socks, plates, sheets) instead of another new video game. <br> <br> May 8th 2017 is going to change that with the introduction of FUNCTIONALIDAY! Swap practical presents with your closest friends and loved ones and ensure they love them by ASKING WHAT THEY NEED BEFORE SHOPPING.</p>
