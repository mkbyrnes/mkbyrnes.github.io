	 <p id="intro"> Hello! I am Arnold the Dog, a six year old rescue from The North Shore Animal League. 
	 I enjoy long naps and short walks in the park. I'm friendly with people, but I have a few things to watch out for: </p>

	<UL id="list"> 
	<li> I'm nervous around tall men
	<li> I do not love strange children
	<li> Closed doors make me anxious
	<li> I like it best when people remove their coats quickly when they come in

<h4> Vet Visit 4.24</h3>


	<p id="blog"> I got to got see Dr.Loose today and it was great! I'm was having a problem with my paw  but the good doctor gave me some medicine and it is healing nicely now. We did a quick check up and everything was good except I'm getting a bit too heavy from all the extra training treats so Im going to need to cut back a bit and exercise more. Hard to belive my little legs can handle more exercise though!

<h4> Old Dog, New Tricks 4.10</h3>


	<p id="blog"> Its been a few weeks since the last visit with Mark, the people trainer Mom and Dad hired to help them teach me some tricks. So far I have mastered sit, down, stay, off and place. I will come pretty readily to mom, but not so much to dad because hes stingy with the treats. All of the tricks are a WIP for me and I need to practice everyday!

<h4> Getting Settled 4.1</h3>


	<p id="blog"> My first few months in my new home have been great. There have been a few growing pains, but mom, dad and I have been getting used to eachother and learning what makes one another tick. </p>
